# User stories
As a movie enthusiast, I want to use a movie interface to explore and discover new movies, as well as access information and details about my favorite movies. This user story can be broken down into several tasks and actions:

Browsing Movies: As a user, I want to browse a collection of movies, either by genre, popularity, or release date. I should be able to view a list of movie posters or titles to select from.

Viewing Movie Details: Once I select a movie, I want to view its details, such as the title, release date, genres, overview, and rating. This should provide me with a comprehensive overview of the movie.

Watching Trailers: I want the ability to watch trailers for movies to get a better sense of their content and style. This feature should provide a seamless integration with a video player or streaming platform.

Searching for Movies: I should be able to search for specific movies by title or keywords. The search functionality should provide relevant results and allow me to quickly find movies of interest.
